              <div id="columns">
              A real estate broker, real estate agent or realtor is a person who represents sellers or buyers of real estate or real property. While a broker may work independently, an agent usually works under a licensed broker to represent clients. Brokers and agents are licensed by the state to negotiate sales agreements and manage the documentation required for closing real estate transactions. In North America, some brokers and agents are members of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the largest trade association for the industry. NAR members are obligated by a code of ethics that go above and beyond state legal requirements to work in the best interest of the client. Buyers and sellers are generally advised to consult a licensed real estate professional for a written definition of an individual state's laws of agency, and many states require written disclosures to be signed by all parties outlining the duties and obligations.

            <h3>What does a real estate broker do?</h3>
            <p>Brokers are licensed to do everything a real estate agent does, including negotiating and writing property transactions, but brokers can also assist agents if an issue occurs during any part of the home-buying or selling transaction. 

            Because brokers have a higher level of licensing, which requires more classwork hours and tougher exams, real estate brokers are in a position to supervise and guide agents and oversee transactions. 

            When shopping for a home, youâ€™re more likely to work with an agent, as most brokers spend their days overseeing the real estate brokerage and supervising individual agents. </p>
