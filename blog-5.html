                <h2><mark>Is Getting Pre-approved for a Home Loan the Same as Pre-qualifying?</mark></h2>

                <div id="resizable">
                    <h3>What’s the difference?</h3>
                    <p>Many say that pre-qualification is the preliminary step in the mortgage process, where a lender runs your credit and talks to you about your goals, and pre-approval takes it one step further by requiring verification of your pay stubs and tax returns. But in reality, these two terms are often used interchangeably. According to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, there is often not much difference between pre-approval and pre-qualification. Sometimes, different lenders may even have different definitions for each. Confusing, right?</p>

                    <h3>So which one do you need?</h3>
                    <p>The end goal is the same: to give sellers the confidence to accept your offer. So make sure you understand what you’re getting, and find out exactly how your lender defines “pre-approval” or “pre-qualification.” Talk to your real estate agent to determine which is more credible in your market.</p><br>

                    <p>Regardless of what your lender calls it, you’ll receive a letter that states they are willing to let you borrow a specific amount of money. But remember, neither pre-approval nor pre-qualification (we’ll stick with “pre-approval” from here on out to make it simple) is a guarantee that you’ll get a home loan. Neither is an offer to lend, a commitment to make a loan or a guarantee of specific rates or terms. The lender may want additional documentation and will need to do an appraisal of your new home before actually extending a loan.<br>

                    That means even though you have the pre-approval letter in your hands, this is NOT the time to go buy a new car, quit your job or run up credit card debt. Any big changes to your finances or debt load are likely to be picked up once you actually apply for a mortgage loan. Lenders aren’t committed. But on the flip side, neither are you. A lot of buyers think once they’ve got a pre-approval letter they have to use that lender. You don’t.</p>

                    <h3>Why you should seek pre-approval</h3>
                    <p>At this point, you may be thinking that the right time to get pre-approved is right when you find the home you want to buy. But getting a pre-approval letter at the beginning of your home search has many advantages.<br>

                    First, you’ll know upfront what kind of loan you will be approved for. That can help set your price range. You can also get pre-approval from multiple lenders. Remember, just as the lenders haven’t fully committed to give you a loan, you don’t have to fully commit to getting your loan from them. Even if you use the letter as part of an offer, you are still free to get your loan elsewhere if you find a better deal. Use the pre-approval process to compare rates and lenders. And don’t worry about multiple credit pulls damaging your credit score. Within a two-week period, all mortgage inquiries only count as a single pull.<br>

                    Second, you’ll be able to move fast. Pre-approval letters are good for a specific period of time, usually 60 to 90 days. Getting pre-approved early can help you be ready to send in an offer ASAP because you won’t have to wait a couple of days for the lender to issue you a pre-approval letter.</p>
